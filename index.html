    <p>The <em>Common American Crow</em> is AWESOME because <strong>â€¢ they have the largest brain:body ratio for a bird</strong></p>
   
    <strong>
    <ul>
      <li>their brains have extremely similar build like humans</li>
      <li>are capable of facial recognition</li>
      <li>can hold a grudge</li>
      <li>have accents and dialects that vary from place to place</li>
      <li>they hold funerals for their dead</li>
      <li>drop hard to open food (nuts) onto the road, because they know it'll be opened by the tires of cars</li>
      <li>know how to craft tools</li>
      <li>are responsible for over 100 power outages every year because they steal cables to build nests</li>
      <li>use anti-bird spikes to guard their own nests</li>
      <li>they can play; throwing snow at eachother, going down slides, standing on spinning things</li>
      <li>mate for life</li>
      <li>once they have a partner, they will both adopt a shared name that is special to the union</li>
      <li>they have complex social structure</li>
    </ul>
